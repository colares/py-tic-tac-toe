## How to play it
I hadn't planned to create this section. But I did, since the use interface is not THAT amazing.

**Consider this as an opportunity to collaborate :)**

* Input a pair of numbers, from 1 to 3 each. 
* The first number stands for the column. The second, the line.
* Example: ```23```. Column ```2```, line ```3```.
* Press ````Enter``` and let your enemy make a move. This war, my friend.
      
 **Buckle up and enjoy a marvel experience! :)**
